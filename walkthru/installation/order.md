You'll notice that links to your Docusaurus walkthrus are displayed in the left sidebar.

By default, these will be ordered alphabetically. 

To order them another way, you can add an `order` property to the config file of each walkthru and assign it a positive integer value.

Walkthrus will then be ordered by this value (ascending).
