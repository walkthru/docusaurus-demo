A great way to use WalkThru is to add it to your Docusaurus site as a preset. This easy to do with the `docusaurus-preset-walkthru` package.

You can install it in a Docusaurus 2 site with NPM:

```
npm i -S docusaurus-preset-walkthru
```

Next, we'll go through the steps of configuring the preset.
