title: Adding WalkThrus
---

To add walkthrus to your project, create a *walkthru* directory.

Each separate walkthru should be in a subfolder here e.g. *walkthru/my-walkthru*.

When this is done, start the dev server and Docusaurus will automatically find and compile any walkthrus you've added.

For further instructions on creating a walkthru, consult the docs.
